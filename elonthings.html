      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"When Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars, people said, 'Nah, what's wrong with a horse?' That was a huge bet he made, and it worked."-Elon Musk/CEO</i></p>
      <h6 class="w3-justify">Elon Musk is the founder of SpaceX and Tesla aswell as the Boring Company. He sold his first
       game at the age of 12, a game called Blastar where you shot asteroids, he sold it for $500. He founded Zip2 with his
     brother Kimbal and founded X.com later PayPal, all this and running a speakeasy with his friends from his college frat house in Canada.
   He founded SpaceX with the money he got from when Ebay bought PayPal and started building his own rockets, along the way developing new innovative
  technologies to boost our understanding of space travel. He helped build Tesla from what it was and is now its CEO. He then founded the Boring Company,
 tasked with boring a hole under LA to send cars on platforms, basically a train but your car is the carriage and the station is any major LA highway.
Elon is changing the world with his companies and the people around him.</h6>

          <h3>SEC Can't Take A Joke</h3>
          <p>After Elons Tweet about taking Tesla private he was investigated by the SEC and the Justice Department.
          This comes just days before he is investigated by the air force for smoking marajuana with Joe Rogan.
        The SEC reached a settlement with Musk, making him payout $20M for his Tweet. Elon will now have a moderator
       review his actions on Twitter.</p>

          <h3>Joe Rogan Podcast</h3>
          <p>Sometimes you wonder what gave a guy the inspiration to build the worlds most powerful rocket,
           strap his car to it, launch it to space and then make the boosters land back. But then you realise its Elon Musk.
         After an insightful appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast giving insights into the problems the world faces and the
       true reason he wants to goto Mars, Elon was handed a joint and smoked it. It was in violation of his airforce contract
     despite marajuana being legal in California, the airforce forbids all drugs that may impair your judgement.</p>

          <h3>Donating To Flint</h3>
          <p>A while ago Elon said he'd fix the problem in Flint, Michigan (currently have no safe water),
          last week donating nearly half a million dollars and filtered water fountains to help the cause.
        This boosted his public reputaton after a string of bad luck in the media.</p>

          <h3>Tesla Privatisation</h3>
          <p>After a Tweet stating that Elon could take Tesla private, securing funding at $420 a share, this
          sparked political controversy opening up investigations into Musks financial dealings including his
        taxes. The SEC investigated Musk and Tesla, reaching a settlement of $20M.</p>
