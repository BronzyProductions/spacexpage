        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"I'd like to die on Mars, just not on impact"-Elon Musk/CEO</i></p>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">SpaceX was created when a bunch of rich guys got in
           a room and were like "hey lets send mice to Mars", Elon Musk jumped on
            this idea and funded the project later becoming its lead supporter.
            This was a joke in the space community and every year Elon would be
            sent a block of cheese...get it? :b. Eventually after failing to buy
             ICBM missiles from Russia, he started SpaceX in a bid to build his
             own rocket. After three failed launches of the Falcon 1 and only
             enough money to build one more rocket, the RATSAT mission was
              SpaceX's last hope, and thats the one that worked. Skip ahead a
              few years we have the first landing of an orbital booster, first
               private company to docking with
               ISS, most powerful rocket in the world deploys the Elons personal
                Tesla Roadster and now the first private
                passenger to fly around the moon, on what will be a rocket more
                powerful than the Saturn V rocket that carried the Apollo
                 astronauts to the moon. </h6>

                <p class="w3-justify"> SpaceX's flagship rocket, capable of
                  sending anything the size of a city bus into geostationary or
                  low earth orbit. It gets its name from its 9 Merlin 1d engines
                  developed by SpaceX. The biggest feauture of the rocket is to land
                  on one of three landing sites. Two landing sites are named in
                  reference of the book "Hitch-Hikers Guide To The Galaxy"; "Of
                  Course I Still Love You" (Atlantic Ocean) and "Just Read The
                  Instructions" (usually Atlantic Ocean but has a further range).
                  The Falcon 9, though currently being fazed out in favour of the
                  Falcon Heavy, is the rocket that SpaceX achieved nearly all of
                  their major milestones with, including; first landing of an OCB,
                  first private company to dock and birth with ISS. It will soon in
                  2019 be the first private company to send astronauts to the ISS
                  after confirmation of the mission and the crew was made in mid 2018.
                  To hitch a ride on the Falcon 9 it'll set you back about $62M for
                  a full payload. </p>

                    <p class="w3-justify">BFR...what else could it mean right? Well...
                    who wouldn't be cursing after seeing the height of it. The rocket code-named
                  BFR will be the most powerful in the world once finished with Elon stating in
                March that they hope to have a suborbital test of a prototype as early as 2019.
              Of course these are innacuarate timelines which is evidence of SpaceX's crazy
            time schedules for launches. Recently SpaceX has signed the first private paying
          passenger, the founder and CEO of Japanese fashion company ZoZo, Yusaku Maezawa.
        He wants people to imagine what it would have been like if John Lenon, Picaso and other
      great artists could have gone to the moon, and what they would have created when they returned.
    He wants to goto the moon with a number of artists and so they can create what they seen,
   he is paying the ticket price for every artist travelling with him. It is unknown how many artists are going and
 what price is being paid but it is estimated at over $100M each. The BFR project will cost
SpaceX about $5B to develop and the tourist moon mission is set to launch in 2023.</p>

                    <p class="w3-opacity w3-center">"Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging..."-Elon Musk/CEO </p>
                  <p class="w3-justify">The Falcon 1, Falcon 5 (canceled) and then the
                    various versions of the Falcon 9, most recent Block 5, but none
                  of these rockets can compare to the newest edition to the orbital
                rocket fleet. SpaceX has been teasing the Falcon Heavy, the worlds most
              powerful rocket since the cancelation of the Falcon 5 rocket. The Falcon
             Heavy is SpaceX's most anticipated rocket yet. Three boosters, carrying a payload
            to orbit, then the rockets land an can be re-used. Well we seen this in
          February when SpaceX tested the Falcon Heavy with a 95% success. The rocket launched
         from Cape Canaveral, Florida and landed its two side boosters back on landing pads also
       in Cape Canaveral, the main stage was to land on the "Of Course I Still Love You" drone ship
      but missed and made a soft water landing into the ocean. Being a test flight the
    rocket wasn't carrying a satelite but CEO Elon Musks personal Tesla Roadster which
  is yet to be put on sale. The Roadster was painted cherry red and had a mannequin doll
dressed in SpaceX's actual spacesuit that the ISS astronauts will be wearing, the astronaut was
called Starman and according to Musk a mini version of the car and Starman was on the dashboard aswell
as "Don't Panic" written on the dashboard which is another reference to the book
"Hitch-Hikers Guide To The Galaxy" which was also in the car inside the glove box. The car
with Starman is in its own orbit around the sun and is currently moving away from Mars.
The next launch of the Falcon Heavy was set for last Jnauary for a military satelite
but since has gotten updated to be "TBD". The Arabsat satelite satelite is the next
launch scheduled for December. To get a payload on the rocket it will cost about $90M.</p>

                    <p class="w3-justify">By the time I'm finished writing this Elon Would've already done
					something stupid on Twitter. But hey "Don't Panic". Elon Reeves Musk was born in South Africa
					to a mechanic father and model mother, both of his parents were bright and Elon picked up skills
					from his fathers business fixing engines, cars and other jobs. The biography written on him by Ashlee
					Vance portrays his childhood as rough and challenging. After his friend was beaten up for being friends with him
					 he was kicked down a flight of stairs and beaten until all that could be seen was a pool of blood. Elon remained introvert
					 for his childhood and was friends with his cousins lecturing them on what he was working on. Elon has a state of
					  mind that allows him to turn off during any event at any time and block out everything and design a rocket in his head
					   or a new car or a new company, his parents believed he was deaf due to this. He built a game called "Blastar" when he was 12
					   and sold it for $500, making the code public.</p>

					   <p> He moved to Canada in his college days and ran a speakeasy from their frat house that took in a lot of income.
					   While with his brother he started Zip2, the yellow pages of the internet, it was the Google Maps of its time and gave directions
					    as well as showing the names of business, post codes etc. Later founding X.com later to be bought by Confinity (changed to PayPal) and later bought by Ebay.
						With the cash from the Ebay buyout Elon began looking into the feasibility of buying ICBM missiles from Russia to build his own rocket, he also started working
						 with a group of engineers to develop an all electric car, the Roadster. That all brings us to now, where he is investigated, smoking weed, accusing divers of pedophelia by
						  day but being Iron Man by night.</p>
